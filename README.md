# J!Blesta

This repository contains the PHP code used to create and perform the integration of the Joomla CMS and the Blesta billing application.

Development was discontinued in 2015 so the latest releases of Blesta and Joomla! at that time are supported (Joomla 3.x and Blesta 3.x) but the code may be easily updated and used in the future.

J!Blesta does require the Dunamis framework to function on both the Joomla side and the Blesta side.
